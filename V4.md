# Breadcrumbs V4

V4 is a complete rewrite of the plugin. As a result:

-   Many long-standing issues are now resolved
-   Most features have been reimplimented with backwards-compatiable behaviour.
-   There are also some breaking changes (marked with "⚠️").

## Usage

You can start using V4 right now by installing it with the BRAT plugin

> [!TIP] There are still some logs enabled in these early stages.
> One particularly helpful log happens everytime you rebuild the graph, and are prefixed with `explicit_edge_results`. These logs tell you any warnings/errors that occured when rebuilding the graph, and which file had the error.

## Changes

### Foundational Changes

-   Nodes are added to the graph using their full path, not just their basename. This fixes issue: TODO
-   Implied relationships are customizable per-Hierarchy, not just globally. This resolves: TODO

### Features

Legend:

-   ✅: Already implemented. Working as previously, and possibly better.
-   ⌚: Working on, still intend to implement.
-   ❌: Removed, don't plan to implement.
-   ❔: Undecided for now.

#### Graph Builders

Previously referred to as "Alternative Hierarchies", these are the various ways to add edges to the Breadcrumbs graph.

-   ✅ Regular frontmatter links (`up: [[note]]` in YAML)
-   ✅ Dataview links (`up:: [[note]]`)
-   ✅ Tag notes
-   ✅ List notes (previously called "Hierarchy notes")
-   ✅ Dendron notes
-   ✅ Date notes
-   ✅ Folder notes
-   ❔ CSV notes
-   ❔ Regex notes
-   ❔ Traverse notes

#### Commands

-   ✅ Create index from note (and copy to clipboard)
-   ✅ Write Breadcrumbs to file (now called "Freeze implied edges")

#### Views

-   ✅ Matrix view
-   ✅ Previous/Next view
-   ✅ Grid view
-   ✅ Path view (previously called "Trail view". Grid view and Path view are now just ways to _show_ the "Trail view")
-   ✅ Tree view
-   ❔ Juggl view
-   ❔ Ducks view (probably not)
-   ❌ Visualisations View (far too complicated, never quite worked)

#### Codeblocks

-   ✅ Tree
-   ❔ Juggl

#### API

-   ⌚

#### Breaking Changes ⚠️

-   The `BC-tag-note` field is now called `BC-tag-note-tag`.
    -   You will be notified if any notes use the old syntax, so you can change them.
-   The setting for specifying which notes to treat as List notes (previously "Hierarchy notes") now uses a frontmatter field instead. So whereas previously you listed all List note names in one setting, you now have to use the `BC-list-note-field` in each of your list notes.
-   The `Refresh Breacrumbs Index` command is renamed to `Rebuild graph`. You will therefore need to rebind any hotkeys.
