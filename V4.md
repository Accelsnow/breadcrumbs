# Breadcrumbs V4

V4 is a complete rewrite of the plugin. As a result:

-   Many long-standing issues are now resolved
-   Most features have been reimplimented with backwards-compatiable behaviour.
-   There are also some breaking changes (marked with "⚠️").

## Usage

You can start using V4 right now by installing it with the BRAT plugin

> [!warning] Your Breadcrumbs settings will be migrated to the new format.
> Features that have already been reimplemented will retain their old settings. But missing features will lose their settings.

## Changes

### Foundational Changes

-   Nodes are added to the graph using their full path, not just their basename. This fixes issue: TODO
-   Implied relationships are customizable per-Hierarchy, not just globally. This resolves: TODO

### Features

Legend:

-   ✅: Already implemented. Working as previously, and possibly better.
-   ⌚: Working on, still intend to implement.
-   ❌: Removed, don't plan to implement.
-   ❔: Undecided for now.

#### Graph Builders

Previously referred to as "Alternative Hierarchies", these are the various ways to add edges to the Breadcrumbs graph.

-   ✅ Regular frontmatter links (`up: [[note]]` in YAML)
-   ✅ Dataview links (`up:: [[note]]`)
-   ✅ Tag notes
-   ✅ List notes (previously called "Hierarchy notes")
-   ✅ Dendron notes
-   ❔ CSV notes
-   ❔ Date notes
-   ❔ Folder notes
-   ❔ Regex notes
-   ❔ Traverse notes

#### Commands

-   ✅ Create index from note (and copy to clipboard)
-   ⌚ Write Breadcrumbs to file

#### Views

-   ✅ Matrix view
-   ✅ Grid view
-   ❌ Trail view (too similar to Grid view)
-   ✅ Previous Next view
-   ❌ Visualisations View (far too complicated, never quite worked)
-   ❔ Juggl view
-   ❔ Ducks view
-   ❔ Tree view

#### Codeblocks

-   ✅ Implemented

#### API

-   ❔ Probably

#### Breaking Changes ⚠️

-   The `BC-tag-note` field is now called `BC-tag-note-tag`.
    -   You will be notified if any notes use the old syntax, so you can change them.
-   The setting for specifying which notes to treat as List notes (previously "Hierarchy notes") now uses a frontmatter field instead. So whereas previously, you listed all List note names in one setting, now you have to use the `BC-list-note-field` in each of your list notes.
